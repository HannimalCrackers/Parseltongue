Searching for datasets for MALS 75500 project.

TECHNOLOGY

Using [Full Page Screen Capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/full-page-screen-capture/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl/related?hl=en) Chrome extension to create screen grabs of contents of page so I can compare downloaded contents to what was displayed later.

Using [Downloader for Instagram](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downloader-for-instagram/olkpikmlhoaojbbmmpejnimiglejmboe/related) Chrome Extension to download all instagram photos from accounts. Encountering something unexpected.


TECH DISCREPANCY

As of today, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's instagram says it has 382 posts, but the downloader identified 382, but then it downloaded 459 items. I tested with my own account and the number of items it says are posted exactly matched the number the downloader identifies. Meanwhile, the NYC Gov account says it has 374, the downloader said there were 371, but the downloader downloaded 387.

Weird. I'm curious about the extra images (extra AOC images particularly).
