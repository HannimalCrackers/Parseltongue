Searching for datasets for MALS 75500 project.

Using [Downloader for Instagram](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/downloader-for-instagram/olkpikmlhoaojbbmmpejnimiglejmboe/related) to download all instagram photos from accounts. Encountering something unexpected.

As of today, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's instagram says it has 382 posts, but the downloader identified 382, but then it downloaded 459 items. I tested with my own account and the number of items it says are posted exactly matched the number the downloader identifies. Meanwhile, the NYC Gov account says it has 374, the downloader said there were 371, but the downloader downloaded 387.

Weird. I'm curious about the extra AOC images.
