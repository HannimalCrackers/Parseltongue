# adventures into chatbots

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Progress so far: I will use [Pandorabots](http://www.pandorabots.com) for my first bot foray. Seems credible based on competition success of [Mitsuku](https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/). 

I have created a bot for work content testing. My bot is named Bartleby.

What's annoying is I can no longer see the regular homepage for pandorabots.com. Now that I've started the process of building a bot, the site redirects straight to my dashboard and I can't escape.

Next step: complete the AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markdown Language) [Quick Start](https://playground.pandorabots.com/en/quickstart/).

### bot thoughts

Project idea: feeding distinct corpora into different bots. Those bots are arrayed as a dinner party. User can interact with the different bots and see how they respond.

Or it's a cocktail party, and you can teleport around in VR and interact with VR representations of the bots?
