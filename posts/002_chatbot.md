# learnin' about chatbots

Progress so far: identified [Pandorabots](http://www.pandorabots.com) for my first bot foray. Seems credible based on competition success of [Mitsuku](https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/). 

What's annoying is I can no longer see the regular homepage for pandorabots.com. Now that I've started the process of building a bot, the site redirects straight to my dashboard and I can't escaper.

About to start the AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markdown Language) [Quick Start](https://playground.pandorabots.com/en/quickstart/).
