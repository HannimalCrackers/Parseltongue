# adventure into chatbots

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Progress so far: I will use [Pandorabots](http://www.pandorabots.com) for my first bot foray. Seems credible based on competition success of [Mitsuku](https://www.pandorabots.com/mitsuku/). 

I have created a bot for work content testing. My bot is named Bartleby.

The only editing area I can see looks and functions nothing like the easy-to-use "playground" depicted in the quickstart guide. Is the playground only for paid users, perhaps?

Next step: finish reading the AIML (Artificial Intelligence Markdown Language) [Quick Start](https://playground.pandorabots.com/en/quickstart/).

### bot thoughts

Project idea: feeding distinct corpora into different bots. Those bots are arrayed as a dinner party. User can interact with the different bots and see how they respond.

Or it's a cocktail party, and you can teleport around in VR and interact with VR representations of the bots?

Visual representation of each bot will take into account any bot response to questions "what do you look like?" or "how do you appear?"
