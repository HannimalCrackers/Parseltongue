I found the 'GIS and Literary History' reading by Patricia Murrieta-Flores et al very interesting. The concepts of Cost Surface Analysis and friction maps were new to me. Below is a friction map illustration of 'Bartleby, the Scrivener' by Herman Melville. This depicts the period toward the end of the story where Bartleby ceases to move or comply with requests. The space Bartleby occupies is represented by his answer to all requests, "I would prefer not to." 

An animation over time might show the squares around Bartleby changing hue from a green that indicates positive inducement to movement, to red indicating high friction / low incentive to action. An alternate reading might be that the state of inaction changes from high friction to most desirable, which could be shown by the space Bartleby himself occupies changing from red to green*.



*There are certain colorblind-friendly combinations of red and green hues, though a different divergent color scheme might be clearer. For black and white reproduction, this could be represented by a heat map showing changes in lightness and/or an increasingly dense pattern.

### 2. The Stranger x Weather Mapping Symbols

I'm sure I'm not the first person to make this illustration of The Stranger by Albert Camus, but it entertains me. As a side note, weather mapping could certainly do with better ways to show uncertainty.
