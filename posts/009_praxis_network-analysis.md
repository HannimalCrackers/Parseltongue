It would be interesting to do a network analysis of the digital humanities Twitter community.


Doesn't distinguish between authors and editors
Had to split apart collaborative works into individual authors
Doesn't include works that had no author or editor listed


Manual cleanup to format all names the same, potential for error to have been introduced


Names
Name changes, such as due to a change in marital status, will appear as two different people. This predominantly affects women and, without a corrective in place, could make them appear less central in graphed networks.

There are instances where people may have published with different initials. In the bibliography to Hockey's 'The History of Humanities Computing,' an article by 'Wisbey, R.' is listed just above a collection edited by 'Wisbey, R. A.' These may be the same person but it is not clear. 'Robinson, P.' and 'Robinson, P. M. W.' are separately listed authors for works about Chaucer and are likely the same person, but from the data alone I cannot be 100% certain. I chose to not manually intervene nor consolidate any entries. It seems too selective to do so only with the name variations I notice but not to do so for less obvious name changes, such as the marital ones.

However, I still have another issue with personal names. The majority of bibiographies in the set I examined give the person's full first and last name.
