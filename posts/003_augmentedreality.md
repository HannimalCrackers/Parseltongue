# adventure into augmented reality

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

I'm interested in dipping a toe into layering virtual content over reality with AR. I just signed up for a personal account with [ZapWorks](https://zap.works).

One hurdle I expect to encounter â€“ I don't have any experience creating or working with 3D models.

I'd like to try out a 3D scanner.

my favorite 3D was a low-polygon fox: the [arctic fox in Cardboard's Arctic Jouney](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple49/v4/d4/66/98/d466986e-0d6e-f258-43c9-4c3af0ba1a6c/en-US-iOS-5.5-in_3.png/643x0w.png) was so well made. It was low polygon, yet perfectly conveyed the animal. I loved the glowing golden eyes, and the "come play" stretch. Excellent design.
