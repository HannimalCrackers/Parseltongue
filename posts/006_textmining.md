I'm trying to do something productive with how sick I feel at how hostile American culture remains toward women and how overwhelmingly prevalent is violence against us.

For this project I examined Senators' public statements on the Kavanaugh nomination in the wake of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's accusations. 

My working list of Senators is from an XML file I downloaded from the United States Senate website. https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

I opened the XML file in Excel and removed information not relevant to my text mining project, such as each Senate member's office address. I kept each member's last name, first name, state represented, party affiliation, and official webpage URL. All data has been posted online to Google Sheets [URL here]

My corpus for analysis came from searching the term "Kavanaugh" on each Senator's official website using their search function. I reviewed the first 20 search results on each website and harvested the first (up to three) which met my criteria. My criteria were that they be direct, formal press released statements about Kavanaugh issued on or after September 15, 2018. Some Senators had few or no formal statements in that period. I did not include speeches, video, news articles or shows, or op-eds in my results. I only included formal statements. For instances in which statements included quoted text and text outside of the quote area, I included only the quote area.

*Bob Corker did not have a search function on his page. I took manually scanned the titles in the News section of his site to find results.



Should I be using Open Office or some other less proprietary solution than Excel? Maybe. That is a topic for another post.

It's valuable to understand that race and gender are categories that aren't always experienced internally the same as they are externally perceived. Still, it's problematic to throw out the categories entirely, lest we should lose why it's unsettling that the major groups of power in America tend to all look like this.  [photo of GOP leaders]
