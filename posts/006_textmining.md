I'm trying to do something productive with how sick I feel at how hostile American culture remains toward women and how overwhelmingly prevalent is violence against us.

My working list of Senators is from an XML file I downloaded from the United States Senate website. https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

I opened the XML file in Excel and removed information not relevant to my text mining project, such as each Senate member's office address. I kept each member's last name, first name, state represented, party affiliation, and official webpage URL.

My corpus for analysis came from searching the term "Kavanaugh" on each Senator's official website using their search function. I initially planned on harvesting results from September 15, 2018 through 5:00pm EST today, October 5, 2018, however I was immediately thwarted on the first Senate website I visited. Lamar Alexander's website returned 611 results for "Kavanaugh" with no indication of how they were sorted. I could only tell that it wasn't by date. I changed course and decided to review the first 20 results on each page and harvest the first (up to three) direct, formally issues press release statements about Kavanaugh issued on September 15, 2018 or thereafter from each Senator's website. Some Senators (e.g., Barrasso) had fewer formal statements, preferring instead to deliver their opinions in speeches or on news shows. I did not include speeches, video, news articles or op-eds in my results. I only included formal statements. For instances in which statements included quoted text and text outside of quotes, I included only the quoted text.

Senate websites were particularly slow to respond. I don't know if this is always the case or if it was getting overrun in the wake of Susan Collins statement that she intends to vote to confirm Kavanaugh.


*Bob Corker did not have a search function on his page. I took manually scanned the titles in the News section of his site to find results.



Should I be using Open Office or some other less proprietary solution than Excel? Maybe. That is a topic for another post.

It's valuable to understand that race and gender are categories that aren't always experienced internally the same as they are externally perceived. Still, it's problematic to throw out the categories entirely, lest we should lose why it's unsettling that the major groups of power in America tend to all look like this.  [photo of GOP leaders]
