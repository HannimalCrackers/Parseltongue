Set up Google Analytics and added the code to the index.html file to test it out. Reading my 1 visitor (myself). I'm going with Flask as a framework. Having less built in will help/force me to learn what the different components do. I conda installed Flask and set up a Hello World Flask file. It worked running locally. Then I realized I should be working in a virtual environment, so I set one up in Anaconda.

To deploy Flask I need a webserver. Will probably go with Apache, since I've heard of it before and, while I want to learn, I don't want to go down a deep rabbit hole at every single decision point. However, having skimmed the [deployment](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/deploying/#deployment) instructions, I'm not clear on how this goes. I'll need to read the instructions, including pointing to my virtual env, more closely when I pick this back up.

In the meantime, I've updated my homepage index file to note the impending change.

### progress 180812

I registered the domain www.hannimalcrackers.com 5 or 6 months ago through Squarespace and pointed it at that time to my Squarespace graphics portfolio site. I've since been learning Python (aka parseltongue) and want to build a website to host my Python projects. I'll be using the hannimalcrackers.com domain for this new site.

I set up a hosting package with inmotion hosting because CNET recommended them and ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. I planned to transfer management of the hannimalcrackers.com domain over to inmotion as well, but I would have had to take my privacy off it and set that back up again, which sounded like a pain, so instead I just pointed the nameservers to inmotion.

I wrote a quick hello HTML to test that all is working. Success. I also created an animal cracker favicon by outlining a photo of an animal cracker in Photoshop.
