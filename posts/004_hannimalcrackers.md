# setting up hannimalcrackers.com

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### progress so far

I registered the domain www.hannimalcrackers.com 5 or 6 months ago through Squarespace and pointed it at that time to my Squarespace graphics portfolio site. I've since been learning Python (aka parseltongue) and want to build a website to host my Python projects. I'll be using the hannimalcrackers.com domain for this new site.

I set up a hosting package with inmotion hosting because CNET recommended them and ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. I planned to transfer management of the hannimalcrackers.com domain over to inmotion as well, but I would have had to take my privacy off it and set that back up again, which sounded like a pain, so instead I just pointed the nameservers to inmotion.

I wrote a quick hello HTML to test that all is working. Success.
